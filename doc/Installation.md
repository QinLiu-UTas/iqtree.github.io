# Installation

The easiest way to install IQ-TREE is to download the precompiled executables (available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) from the Download page <https://github.com/Cibiv/IQTree/wiki/Download>.

To compile the source code, please first make sure that [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) was installed.
