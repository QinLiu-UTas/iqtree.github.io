# Recipes

This is a collection of detailed examples analyses that combine IQ-TREE with other bits of code and/or software (hence 'recipes'). They are an attempt to go a bit beyond the usual user docs for software, getting closer to end-to-end analyses. The idea is a searchable and reproducible database of analyses to help the community do what they need to with IQ-TREE.

If you'd like to request a recipe, please head over to the issues page and use the 'recipe wanted' label, and describe in as much detail as possible (with references and example data if you can) what it is you would like.
