  title: The Prevalence and Impact of Model Violations in Phylogenetic Analysis
  container-title: Genome Biol. Evol.

  volume: '11'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Abstract In phylogenetic inference, we commonly use models of substitution
    which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous
    (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH
    violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and
    edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal
    matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model
    violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show
    that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5%) reject the
    SRH assumptions, and that for 25% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from
    all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset
    of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases
    when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the
    SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH
    assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation
    in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing
    for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior
    to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing
    models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in
    the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis
    are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe
    are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).
