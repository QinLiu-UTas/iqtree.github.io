A user opinion on IQ-TREE:

>The results look promising with tree topology, branch length, and support values showing broad correlation (see below for data). The fact that this is an actively developed piece of software, with good documentation and some good peer reviewed papers gives me confidence to try this for the next few phylogenetic analyses I need to run.
