We have released an IQ-TREE variant which implements a heterotachy mixture model accounting for heterotachous evolution — rate heterogeneity among sites and lineages. This version can be downloaded from here: 

<http://www.iqtree.org/#variant> 

A user guide is available at <http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Heterotachy-Models/>. 

Please note that this is still a pre-release version — so suggestions and feedback are welcome!
