Version 1.3.7 is released with following changes:

* Fix a bug introduced in 1.3.6 for new model selection procedure (`-m TESTNEW`).
* Include L-BFGS-B algorithm (code taken from HAL_HAS package ([Jayaswal et al., 2014]) as the default to estimate model parameters. L-BFGS-B performs better than the previous BFGS implementation, for example, when optimizing LG4X and FreeRate models.
* New option `-suptag` (used with `-sup`) when assigning support values from a set of input trees into a given tree, each tagged branch in the given tree will be assigned values of form `support@tree1@tree2@...@treeK`, corresponding to the IDs of the input tree where this branch occurs (requested by Max Maronna).
* New option `-t RANDOM` to start tree search from a random starting tree (requested by Karen Meusemann).
