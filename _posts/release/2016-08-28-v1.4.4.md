New features:

- Allowing mixture frequency model with optimized frequency via e.g. `-m C10+FO` (requested by Edward Braun).
- Supporting `GTR20` (general time reversible) amino-acid model (requested by Desmond Ramirez, Panagiotis Adam).
- New option `-blscale` to optimize tree length scaling factor and model parameters for a user tree passed via `-t` option (requested by Rob Lanfear). The results are written to `.blscale` file in YAML format.
- New option `--no-outfiles` to suppress printing all output files (`.log`, `.treefile`, `.iqtree` files).

Bug fixes:

- (critical) Memory overflow for long alignments (>55,000 aa site patterns) under large mixture models (e.g. `C60`) (reported by Matthew Brown).
- (critical) AU test implementation (reported by Jan Janouskovec).
- Counting of constant sites with many ambiguous states (reported by Greg Owens).
