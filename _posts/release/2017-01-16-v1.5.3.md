Version 1.5.3 improves software stability. We thank a lot to all users mentioned below for the reports.

Bug fixes:

* Crash for +R+ASC model (reported by olaf.thalmann).
* Improper multiple restart for I+G model optimization (reported by 98w8h1).
* For large data sets with many sequences: 
    - Incorrect handling of numerical underflow when all state likelihoods are zero (reported by Gerhard Jaeger).
    - Numerical underflow for invariant sites (reported by ledum_laconicum, kelly.schiro).

Other changes:

* Invariable (+I) site model now considers ambiguous constant sites.
* -wba (write bootstrap alignments) works now with standard bootstrap (-b).
