We are pleased to announce the major update 1.2.0 with following new features:

* Supporting mixture models (`C10,...,C60, EX2, EX3, EHO, UL2, UL3, EX_EHO, LG4M, LG4X, JTTCF4G`). 
* User-defined mixture models via syntax (for example, `"MIX{HKY,TN}+G"`) or via a nexus file. Have a look at file `models.nex` in the bin folder of the release version.
* Joint and proportional partition models are now fully functional.
* Automatical switching between SSE and AVX kernels depending on the current hardware. Thus, no separate executables are needed.
* New option `-fconst f1,...,fN` to add a number of const patterns into alignment (N=#states)
* Serveral bug fixes.
