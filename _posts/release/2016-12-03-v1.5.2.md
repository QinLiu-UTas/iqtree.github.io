* Bug when finally merging partitions (-m TESTMERGE) (reported by Olivier Navaud).
* Crash when computing distance with consensus tree in presence of identical sequences (-bb option) (reported by Julien).
* Crash for I+G model when p-invar close to 0 (reported by liqiangj, Frank Wright).
* Bug likelihood scaling for ASC model (reported by lgrismer).

Other changes:

* Fix misleading message about multifurcating trees (reported by Noah Simons).
* Incompatibility problem with older Mac by switching back to libstdc++ instead of libc++ (reported by Matthew Fullmer).
* Fix compilation issue for BSD and newer GCC 5.4 (thanks to @njoly).
* Improved `-nt AUTO` option, e.g. to work with model selection (reported by Remi Denise).
