This version contains bugfixes and improves software stability:

* Improved numerical stability when some state is absent from the alignment, especially with codon or morphological data.
* Allow reading morphological and codon model from file in PAML format.
* Crash when number of partitions > 2^15 (reported by Adela RoaVaron).
* In Windows: Exit gracefully instead of abort when input file does not exist.
* Exit gracefully instead of segfault when log file cannot be written.
* Crash when constraint tree contains identical sequence which was removed (reported by Russell Minton).
* Exit gracefully instead of abort about too many threads for too short alignment.
* Exit gracefully instead of abort when outgroup taxon (`-o` option) does not appear in alignment.
* `-mset` option works with binary and morphological models.
