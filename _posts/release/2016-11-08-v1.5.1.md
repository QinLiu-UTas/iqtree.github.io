We are pleased to announce version 1.5.1 with special focus on huge data sets and supercomputing with following new features:

* Merged the parallel MPI version with much better parallel efficiency and scalability. The old MPI version is deprecated.
* Memory saving mode via a new `-mem` option to restrict RAM usage, helpful for complex mixture models. For example, `-mem 64G` to use at most  64 GB. By default, IQ-TREE will try to fit the computer RAM size. Note that this mode does not work with partition models yet.
* Safe numerical mode for huge data sets to avoid "Numerical underflow" errors. This mode is automatically turned on when having more than 2000 sequences. It can be manually turned on via `-safe` option.
* New option `-nt AUTO` to automatically determine best number of threads in multicore version.
* Support AVX2 instructions.
