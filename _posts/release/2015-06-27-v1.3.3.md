We are pleased to announce version 1.3.3 with substantial improvements:

* Implement the relaxed clustering algorithm of PartitionFinder with `-rcluster` option to speed up analysis for data sets with many partitions (e.g., >100 partitions).
* Partition finding supports multicore now with linear speedup.
* Increased multicore performance of partition model analysis.
* Support direct translation of coding sequences into amino-acid (`-st NT2AA` option).
* Adjust per-partition state frequencies for partition model such that the log-likelihoods are fully comparable with RAxML.
* Print sequence identity scores along the tree (`-wsi` option).
* Fix slow convergence of partition model parameter estimation with many partitions.
* Fix memory allocation for large mixture models.
