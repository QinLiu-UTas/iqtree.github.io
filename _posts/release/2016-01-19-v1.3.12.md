Bug fixes:

* A crash when performing analysis on partitioning schemes produced by the k-means algorithm of PartitionFinder (reported by Pete Hosner). This is due to a partition containing only constant sites and the other partitions containing only variable sites. Such partitioning schemes are not recommended for phylogenetic analysis and users are advised to consult PartitionFinder author.

* A crash with too high or too low rates for FreeRate model (reported by Hermes Escalona and Adrian Arellano Davin).
