We are pleased to announce version 1.3.9 with following notable changes:

* Several bug fixes improving software stability. Special thanks to Xiaofan, Karen Meusemann, Jozsef Bakonyi, Renee, Peter Hosner for reporting bugs.
* A more stable expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented to optimize parameters of the FreeRate [`+R`] and `LG4X` model. Special thanks to Edward Susko, Thomas Wong and Lars Jermiin.
* Several new features (requested by users):
    - Option `-wbtl` to write bootstrap tree file (.ufboot) with branch lengths.
    - Option `-madd` to include mixture models into model selection procedure (e.g. `-madd LG4M,LG4X`).
    - Option `-alrt 0` to perform the parametric approximate likelihood ratio (aLRT) branch test ([Anisimova and Gascuel, 2006]).
    - Option `-abayes` to perform the parametric aBayes branch test ([Anisimova et al., 2011]).
* Maximum number of partitions is increased to 16384 instead of 1024.
