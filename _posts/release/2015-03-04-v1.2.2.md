* New option `-mset m1,...,mk` to do model selection from a list of models.
* Support for old Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard).
* Bug fix: numerical issue with `mtMAM` model that unexpectedly stopped model selection.
* Bug fix: `+I+G` likelihood computation did not account for partially constant sites properly.
* Bug fix: optimization of branch lengths sometimes reduced tree likelihood (introduced in ver. 1.2.0).
