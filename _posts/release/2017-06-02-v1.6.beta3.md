We are pleased to release the beta version 1.6.beta (available at <http://www.iqtree.org>) with many new cool features. During this beta-testing phase, feedback is much appreciated.

Notable new features:

* [Polymorphism-aware models](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Polymorphism-Aware-Models)  accounting for _incomplete lineage sorting_ (code contributed by Dominik Schrempf).
* [Lie Markov](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Substitution-Models#lie-markov-models) and non-reversible models (code contributed by Michael Woodhams).
* [Heterotachy models](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Complex-Models#heterotachy-models) accounting for rate variation across sites and lineages.
* Xeon Phi Knights Landing (AVX-512) support with 2X or more speedup.
* New option `-fast` to match the speed of FastTree program while still obtaining better trees [Experimental].

New features:

* `-wql` option now prints quartet area and corner in `.quartetlh` file (requested by Karen Meusemann).
* Support GENE resampling (`-bspec GENE`) and GENESITE resampling (`-bspec GENESITE`) for standard bootstrap with partition models.
* Sequential and multicore versions are merged, thus `iqtree-omp` executable becomes `iqtree`.
