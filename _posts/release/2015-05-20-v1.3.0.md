We are pleased to announce version 1.3.0 with following major updates:

* Support for ClustalW and MSF alignment file formats and RAxML-styled partition file format.
* With Lars Jermiin group we developed a new model selection strategy, which is invoked via option `-m TESTNEW` or `-m TESTNEWONLY`. Among others, it uses the FreeRate model ([Yang, 1995]; [Soubrier et al., 2012]) as replacement for the problematic `I+G` model. FreeRate model is also implemented in PhyML and BEAST 2.
* Improved codon model implementation, which is more compatible with codonPhyML, e.g. including models of ([Kosiol et al., 2007]).
* Codon model selection now allows up to 60 codon models to be tested!
* Improved support for mixture models.
* Accepting two new amino-acids: `U` (Selenocysteine; treated as unknown character) and `J` (`I` or `L`).
* Several bug fixes, including a bug in FreeRate model optimization found and fixed by Thomas Wong and Lars Jermiin.
