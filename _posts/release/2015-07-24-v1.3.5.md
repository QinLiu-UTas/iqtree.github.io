Version 1.3.5 is released with a few fixes (thanks to Lars Jermiin for finding two issues with model selection):

* Thorough model selection (`-mtree`) now prints final tree corresponding to best-fit model.
* Fix slightly decreasing log-likelihood for more complex models during new model selection (`-m TESTNEW`).
* For bootstrap: `.iqtree` report file now includes log-likelihood of consensus tree and Robinson-Foulds distance between found ML tree and consensus tree.
