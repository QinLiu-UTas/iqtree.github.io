 We are happy to announce the major release of IQ-TREE software version 1.0.0 with the following news:

* Integration of the [phylogenetic likelihood library](http://www.libpll.org) for fast likelihood computation. This is enabled via `-pll` option and gives a speedup of 2X to 8X.
* A novel fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum likelihood phylogenies. It outperforms RAxML and PhyML in terms of log-likelihoods while requiring similar amount of computing time. A manuscript describing the new method was submitted.
* NEW MODELS: codon models and ascertainment bias correction model for morphological or single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) data.
* Nearest neighbor interchange with five branch optimization (`-nni5`) is now the default option because of its higher accuracy.
* SH-aLRT branch test also works now for partition models.
