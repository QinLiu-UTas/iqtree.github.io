 Version 1.3.6 is released with following substantial changes:

* An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented to optimize weights of mixture models (thanks to Huaichun Wang, Andrew Roger, Edward Susko for reporting initial issue on local optimum and providing this solution). The EM algorithm guarantees convergence on global optimum ([Wang et al., 2008]).
* Fix an issue in reading morphological alignments (thanks to Max Maronna for reporting this).
* `+I+G` is added back into the candidate model list of new model selection procedure (`-m TESTNEW`).
* The starting phase of tree search now includes a BIONJ into the candidate tree set, which is sometimes better than parsimony trees.
* Building from source code now generates dynamically linked binary. To build static binary, run cmake with e.g. `cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=static source_dir`
