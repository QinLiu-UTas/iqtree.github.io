We are pleased to release the major update 1.1 with the following new enhancements:

* Under-the-hood code optimization for the default likelihood kernel, which gives a speedup up to **5X for DNA and 10X for protein** alignments.
* Support for Windows platforms and support GCC, Clang, MS Visual C++ and Intel C++ compilers.
* Automatical handling of identical sequences in the alignment (no warnings about identical sequences anymore).
* Bootstrap and tree search stopping rule combined for more accurate results.
* Several bugs fixed.
