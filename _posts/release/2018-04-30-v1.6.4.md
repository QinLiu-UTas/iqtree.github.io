News:

* New option `--runs` to perform multiple tree searches (issue #64 requested by David Maddison). This is motivated by a recent evaluation [(Zhou et al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msx302) showing that 10 independent runs outperformed single run in terms of likelihood maximisation.
* Print branch lengths scaled in number of substitutions for PoMo models.
* Support specifying 6 GTR rates and G-T rate to be zero from command line (requested by Ben Redelings).
* New option `--show-lh` to compute tree log-likelihood without parameter optimisation (issue #67).

Bugfixes:

* Fix compilation with gcc 4.8.
* Incorrect parsing `+P` for PoMo model string (thanks Carolin Kosiol).
* Issue #66: Incorrect frequency mixture model when coupled with `GTR20` (reported by Dominik Schrempf).
* .ufboot trees file contains partial branch supports by combination of `-bb` and `-alrt` (reported by Guifre Torruella Cortes).
* Crash in likelihood computation for `+ASC` model when some states are rare (reported by Paul Madeira).
* Numerical instability for codon models by reducing upper bound of omega/kappa from 100 to 50 (reported by Aleksas Lab).
* Crash reading DNA model from file (reported by Benjamin Redelings).
* Crash with `-z` option with rooted trees in the presence of identical sequences (reported by cjp1043).
