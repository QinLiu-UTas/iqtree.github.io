Important changes:

* Temporarily disable AU test due to unresolved numerical issue when bp-rell are all zeros.

Bugfixes:

* Checkpointing issue in ModelFinder for mixture models causing incorrect likelihoods with e.g. `-madd C10` (reported by Juergen Strassert).
* Checkpointing Lie Markov models.
* (v1.6.6) Incomplete parsing of site positions of partition file (reported by Alexey Kozlov).
* Parsing polymorphic states from NEXUS file (reported by Steven Heritage).
* Use of only 1 thread when #partitions < #cores (reported by Alexey Kozlov).
* Double RAM usage for `-bnni` option (reported by Juergen Strassert).
* Over-bound for optimizeTreeLengthScaling causing too long branch lengths in extreme cases (reported by vikaszsi77).
* Exclude ORDERED model by default for morphological data due to frequent numerical underflow.
* (v1.6) `-m ..MERGE..` wrong concatenateAlignments with missing data (reported by David Dunchene).
* Error message instead of crash when using `-bsam` with non-partition model (reported by Sarah Jensen).
