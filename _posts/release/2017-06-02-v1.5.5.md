New features:

* Support gene-resampling (`-bsam GENE`) and gene-site-resampling (`-bsam GENESITE`) for standard bootstrap with partition models.
* Support and treat polymorphic characters in `(...)` or `{...}` notation as missing data (requested by Steven Heritage).
* Improved numerical stability for codon models (reported by Giorgio Matassi, Sarah Mathews, Ricardo Alves). Note that numerics may still fail if many codons are absent in the data.
* Do not test ascertainment bias correction (`+ASC`) for codon models by default (thanks Ricardo Alves).
* Only reduce minimal branch length for long alignment and un-partition models (thanks to Steven Mussmann).

Bugfixes:

* Initial tree generation problem with constrained tree search option `-g`.
* Likelihood underflow for large multifurcating trees (e.g. consensus tree) (reported by Giap Nguyen).
* Crash with `-minsupnew` option (reported by Longzhi Tan).
* Compilation with gcc under Mac (thanks @ilovezfs).
* Crash with -nni1 for partition model -spp (reported by Diep Thi Hoang).
