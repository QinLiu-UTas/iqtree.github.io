We are pleased to announce version 1.3.10 with following changes:
<!--more-->

* Support unlimited number of partitions for partition model analysis (no complaint about PLL_NUM_BRANCHES anymore).
* Improved support for mixture models.
* Fix a bug in ascertainment bias correction [`+ASC`] model causing incorrect branch length estimates (thanks to Marcus Teixeira for reporting it).
* Fix a rare bug when branch lengths are close to upper bound (thanks to Huaichun Wang for reporting it).
