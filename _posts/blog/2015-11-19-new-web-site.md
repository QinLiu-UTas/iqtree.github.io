Dear IQ-TREE users,

We are happy to announce the launch of the new IQ-TREE web site immediately available at the same URL:

[http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree](http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree)

Notably we updated extensive online user documentation for using IQ-TREE including quick start guide, tutorials, command reference, maximum likelihood models and compilation guide. This is to replace the outdated pdf manual.

The IQ-TREE source code is now hosted at github:

[https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE](https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE)

for developersâ€™ convenience.

Best,

[IQ-TREE development team](../about/)
