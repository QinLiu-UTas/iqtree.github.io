It is often hard to predict the significance and long-term impact of new innovations, but the introduction of [ModelFinder (1)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4285), a novel model-selection method for accurate phylogenetic estimates, is likely to be on par with Yang's ground-breaking discovery, in 1994, of a simple one-parameter [Gamma model (2)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00160154) of rate heterogeneity across sites, the [first model-selection method (3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9918953) to be widely used in molecular phylogenetics, and the rise of [Bayesian phylogenetic methods (4)](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026160), [(5)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/17.8.754).

Published in 1994, Yang's one-parameter model has been used in most of the subsequent molecular phylogenetic research but its success has perhaps also led to his other discovery, in 1995, of a [more versatile model (6)](http://www.genetics.org/content/139/2/993.abstract) of rate heterogeneity across sites  being overlooked. ModelFinder includes both models, and the first results show that the more flexible model often is needed to obtain accurate estimates of phylogenetic trees and evolutionary processes. 

> These results call into question much of the last two decades of phylogenetic research, which relied on phylogenetic methodology that ignored the more versatile model of rate heterogeneity across sites.

The advent of ModelFinder opens a new era of opportunities, where accurate phylogenetic estimates can be obtained and used to answer important biological questions, and where controversial as well as long-standing evolutionary hypotheses can be tested using novel ways of modelling sequence evolution.
