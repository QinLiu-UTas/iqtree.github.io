A user opinion on IQ-TREE:

"...The results look promising with tree topology, branch length, and support values showing broad correlation (see below for data). The fact that this is an actively developed piece of software (<https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE>), with good documentation and some good peer reviewed papers (<http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu300> and <http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molbev/mst024>) gives me confidence to try this for the next few phylogenetic analyses I need to run"
